                               I moved to Salt Lake from California, and needed new insurance. Ryan saved me more than $1000 a year on my car insurance alone. And because I bundled it with my renter's insurance, I got another discount, which basically payed itself. Ryan was very knowledgable and helpful. I had a great experience.

                               I've worked with Ryan for a few years now and he's definitely the best insurance agent I've had. He's helped me through water damage at my house, changes in my car insurance, and following up when I've made changes. I know he's genuinely concerned about getting me the best help, rates, and service. Ryan is thorough and easy to talk with, easy to get in contact with, and returns calls quickly. He always makes me feel like I'm his most important client!

                 <p>I've found satisfaction in serving and taking care of others. 
                     This has carried over to my career as an insurance agent when I started here 
                     at Cottonwood Insurance about 17 years ago. I love Cottonwood Insurance because 
                     instead of being tied down to one insurance company, I have gained contracts 
                     with multiple preferred insurance companies which allows me to better service you. 
                     I do my very best to provide personalized service and care to each client. 
                     However, I need to give my staff credit for the fantastic job they do too. 
                     However you like to communicate, whether by e-mail, phone, text, etc. that is the way 
                     I like to communicate and do my best to be as accessible and responsive as possible.
                 </p>
                 <p>I grew up in Cottonwood Heights, attended Brighton High School and graduated 
                     from the University of Utah with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Finance.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     I love cycling with friends and cycling races. I have scaled back from racing 
                     to devote more time to my wife, son, and daughter.
